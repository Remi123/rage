type_expr.hpp
BREAKING CHANGES:
1. the namespace type_expr:: was replaced by te::
    It was previously used everywhere with namespace te = type_expr, but I got sick of it and it's less character, which matter during compilation error where my screen real estate is severly overrun by template error novel.
2. te::cartesian reworked to te::cartesian_<...BinaryFunc> 
    This overcome the problem introduced with the new feature of recursive te::input. It's also more generic
