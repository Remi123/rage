type_expr.hpp
BREAKING CHANGE:
the namespace type_expr:: was replaced by te::
    It was previously used everywhere with namespace te = type_expr, but I got sick of it and it's less character, which matter during compilation error where my screen real estate is severly overrun by template error novel.
Except for this no other changes should impact any user.
